# Image-Classification-using-CNN
- Worked on image classification project 
- Build the project using machine learning algorithm (CNN) 
- Accuracy given by model is 84% on test data 
- Build web app using flask on Spyder IDE

Using a VGG-19 model trained on the A, classify images of flights. CNN is a supervised learning method that requires both input and output data.Convolutional Layers, Pooling Layers, and Fully Connected Dense Networks are the three basic components of a CNN in most cases.The input image is applied to m number of n x n filters by theconvolutional layer to produce a feature map.CNN classifies incoming images by taking a portion or window at a time. Everytime, the convolutional layer of the CNN will generate a feature map for each region. It performs feature extraction in the Pooling layer by removing the superfluous characteristicsand retaining only the most crucial ones for that section. Thus, by using CNNs, we may extra features without using a different method.
